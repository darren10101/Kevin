## Inspiration
We wanted to help people who have awesome ideas but don't necessarily speak "code." So, why not let them speak... literally? By using speech-to-text, we’re making website creation as easy as having a conversation—no typing, no fuss, just talk and watch your site come to life! 🎤✨
## What it does
Kevin utilizes ONLY your voice to generate picture-perfect websites. Speak your vision, and Kevin handles the rest—turning your words into fully functional, responsive websites with accurate layouts, stunning visuals, and clean code. People with visual impairment or physical disabilities can discover the magic of coding with our hands off approach to dev tooling.
## How we built it
Using Web Speech API, we turned your words into the website of your imagination by integrating it with generative AI to instantly create and design responsive, user-friendly web pages. Our amazing agent Kevin is powered by the high performance architecture of Groq. 
## Challenges we ran into
We encountered several challenges during development, including fine-tuning the speech-to-text system to reliably detect trigger words, accurately parse spoken instructions, and recognize the final trigger word to complete the process. Additionally, we struggled with gathering and structuring the necessary data to send to our API for seamless AI-driven website generation, requiring extensive troubleshooting to ensure smooth, uninterrupted functionality.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We’re incredibly proud of getting the app to function as intended, from accurately recognizing voice commands to generating fully functional websites using generative AI. Overcoming the technical challenges to deliver a smooth and reliable user experience is a significant achievement for our team.
## What we learned
Never use a serverless backend with a server.
## What's next for FrontendKevin
Next, we plan to expand the range of design options, add support for more complex website features as well as improve the accuracy of the website generation. We’re also looking to enhance user customization and explore integrations with other AI tools to further streamline the development process.
